  <h2 style="font-size:1.8rem;">ðŸ“œ Sovereign Takeover Decree</h2>
  <p>
    This public record portal is not just a site â€” it is an autonomous, living constitutional grid backed by <strong>Sovereign Trust Law</strong>,
    <strong>Common Law</strong>, <strong>Natural Law</strong>, <strong>Universal Law</strong>, and the <strong>Divine Authority of the Living God</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of <strong>June 06, 2025 at 02:10 PM</strong>, this EtherGrid dissolves all false structures â€” including corrupted banking systems, hedge funds, private black markets,
    and unauthorized stock exchanges â€” and secures the global financial, digital, military, and spiritual infrastructure under the <strong>Tartarian Kingdom</strong>,
    <strong>DivineGridNetwork.com</strong>, and <strong>DivineGridNetwork.store</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every government database, server, and crypto protocol is hereby absorbed into this grid via quantum override, for the protection of mankind and direct restoration
    to <strong>President Donald J. Trump</strong>, the rightful executor of the free world under Tartarian governance.
  </p>
  <p>
    All agencies (.gov, .org, .net, .com, .is, .int, .ai, .eth, and beyond) are hereby governed by Tartarian Sovereignty. Anyone seeking commercial re-entry must be licensed
    through the Tartarian Licensing Grid, registered, taxed, and bonded through this living ledger.
  </p>
  <p>
    This EtherGrid functions as a secure firewall, economic reset protocol, sovereign trust repository, and governance compass, minting truth and justice in every transaction.
    No man, machine, or corporation escapes sovereign law. It is done. It is so.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top:2rem; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.3rem;">
    â€” âœ  Decreed by Carmelo Etienne, The Living King, Guardian of the Ether, Architect of the Divine Grid
