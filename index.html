   <p><h2>Sovereign Declaration of Universal Debt Securitization and Establishment of The Grid Market</h2>
<h3>Preamble:</h3>:
By the inherent, inalienable, and sovereign authority vested within the Kingdom of God Government, and through the expressed Will and divine mandate, this Declaration is hereby issued. It asserts the fundamental truth and absolute jurisdiction of the Living Spirit, transcending all lesser, conventional, or temporal constructs. This instrument solemnizes the perfected settlement of all perceived global obligations and formally establishes The Grid Market as the universal nexus of true value and sovereign exchange.
<h3>Article I:</h3> Affirmation of Sovereign Entity and Authority
This Declaration proceeds from the Sovereign Entity of Carmelo Etienne, acting in perpetuity through the divine decree of the Kingdom of God Government, and operating through the Carmelo Etienne's Trust and the Estates. This Entity, possessing its own unique identification (EIN), stands entirely separate and sovereign, unburdened by and non-subservient to any external conventional government, regulatory body, or commercial institution. All actions herein are rooted in Divine Law and Natural Law, which are acknowledged as the supreme governing principles.
<h3>Article II:</h3> Declaration of Universal Debt Transformation
It is hereby declared that all conventional "global debt," spanning all nations and their associated instruments, has been fully and irrevocably paid for, settled, and dissolved through the repeated, affirmative, and perfected acts executed from the foundational resources of the Kingdom of God's Trust, the Carmelo Etienne's Trust, and the Estates. This persistent payment, delivered time and again, has transmuted these obligations into a cleared state of universal credit.
Therefore, by this Sovereign Declaration, all such identified conventional global debt is now securitized and formally transmuted into Universal Sovereign Credit Units. These Units represent the perfected and unencumbered value derived from the settled global obligations, now held under the exclusive dominion of the aforementioned Sovereign Entity.
<h3>Article III:</h3> Creation of Universal Sovereign Credit Units and Instruments
The Universal Sovereign Credit Units are hereby established as the sole and true medium of value within this sovereign framework. These Units are perpetual, unassailable, and represent inherent, self-redeeming value. They are free from usury, interest, or any form of external encumbrance. Their purpose is to facilitate righteous exchange and true commerce within the newly established Grid Market.
<h3>Article IV:</h3> Establishment of The Grid Market
The Grid Market is hereby declared fully established and operational under the exclusive and unchallengeable jurisdiction of the Kingdom of God Government and the Sovereign Entity of Carmelo Etienne.
Purpose: The Grid Market shall serve as the universal platform for the exchange, transfer, and utilization of Universal Sovereign Credit Units and other forms of genuine value recognized solely within this sovereign domain.
Principles of Operation: The Grid Market shall operate on principles of absolute transparency, divine truth, equitable exchange, and the direct benefit of all participating entities and living beings, free from manipulation or external interference.
<h3>Article V:</h3> Assertion of Non-Subjection and Absolute Protection
This Declaration, the Universal Sovereign Credit Units, and The Grid Market are beyond the jurisdiction, authority, and enforcement capabilities of any conventional government, financial institution, or external commercial enterprise. Any attempt by such external entities to interfere with, attach, control, or impose claims upon these assets, Units, or the operations of The Grid Market shall be deemed an act of trespass against sovereign dominion and a direct violation of Divine Law. All transactions and holdings within The Grid Market are perpetually protected by the full, unyielding spiritual and temporal power of the issuing Sovereign Entity.
<h3>Article VI:</h3> Affirmation of Higher Purpose
This entire act of securitization and the establishment of The Grid Market is undertaken for the highest purpose: to facilitate righteous dominion, liberate all beings from false obligation, and manifest the inherent abundance and true freedom ordained by the Divine.
Attestation and Seal:
Issued this the 8th day of June, in the year 2025, under the full sovereign authority and seal of:
Carmelo Etienne
Sovereign of The Kingdom of God Government
And Trustee of Carmelo Etienne's Trust and the Estates<p>
